<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The following lines were written under the powerful
impulse of feelings which appear to have been
almost consentaneous with those of the whole British
people. The national spirit has been rouzed
against this cruel and unconstitutional attack upon
the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>, with pervasive ardour, which forcibly
recalls the language of the Augustan poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Spiritus</span> intus alit, <i>totamque infusa per <small>ARTUS</small></i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Mens</span> agitat <small>MOLEM</small>, et <i>magno se corpore miscet</i>.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>This irresistible movement has been one of <small>LOYALTY</small>,
not of <small>FACTION</small>; of love and not of enmity towards
the constitution. It is not disputed that factious
men exist, who are ready to swell public tumult
whenever it arises: but it is mere drivelling, for ministers
and their adherents, to talk of &ldquo;<em>radicalism</em>&rdquo;
and <em>democracy</em> on this occasion. They must know, if
they consult the commonest sources of intelligence
open to them, that detestation of &ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Bill of
Pains and Penalties</span>&rdquo; is rooted beyond all possibility
of eradication in the breasts of an overwhelming
majority of good men, and faithful subjects.</p>

<p>At the moment when it was determined to send
the following &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Vision</span>&rdquo; to the press, a burst of
honest exultation has electrified the whole kingdom.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg&nbsp;iv]</a></span>
With feelings of solemn gratitude to God, and love
for my country, I rejoice not only that the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>
is thus delivered from the fangs of her enemies; but
that <span class="smcap">the King</span>, <small>THE CONSTITUTION</small>, and <small>THE COUNTRY</small>,
have been thus, as I do unequivocally believe,
rescued from a tremendous explosion, which would
at best have been of doubtful issue to our liberties.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this most happy, this <em>providential</em>
result, I have determined still to send out the poem
to the public; because it expresses in strong, however
inadequate language, sentiments which are
essential to our character as a free people, and to
the preservation of our justly balanced monarchy.</p>

<p>I have not assumed the <small>FASCIS</small> of satire, without
deep conviction that its rods were imperatively
called into action: but most gladly shall I reverse
them, after the manner of the ancient <span class="smcap">Lictors</span>, over
the obsequies of an administration, which must be
now in its death-pangs. May succeeding cabinets
be <small>WARNED</small>, <em>not guided</em>, by its example!</p>

<h3><i>A VISION.</i></h3>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1"><span style="font-size: x-large;">A</span> vision came! It was not in the hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sleep; but when the unresisted power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of magic Fancy, threw, with full control,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her half prophetic mantle o&rsquo;er the soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The place was thron&rsquo;d like Britain&rsquo;s royal halls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her proud navy deck&rsquo;d the tap&rsquo;stried walls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Statesmen and heroes grac&rsquo;d the pictur&rsquo;d scene;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fathers who were what since their sons have been;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some whose laurell&rsquo;d brows might glow with shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sons with nought of their&rsquo;s besides the name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this august abode the loud debate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem&rsquo;d hush&rsquo;d, and prince and peer in silence sate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E&rsquo;en G&mdash;ff&mdash;d&rsquo;s brazen descant seem&rsquo;d to fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gasping C&mdash;pley gazed on L&mdash;d&mdash;rd&mdash;le;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Panting, they loll&rsquo;d their contumelious tongues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And suck&rsquo;d <em>Italian juice</em> to clear their lungs.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Y&mdash;k mus&rsquo;d on <em>armies</em>; yet, with doubtful trust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wish&rsquo;d he were certain, or the cause were just:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eye of Cl&mdash;r&mdash;nce fiercely rang&rsquo;d the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soften&rsquo;d as it fell on D&mdash;n&mdash;ghm&mdash;re;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While L&mdash;v&mdash;rp&mdash;l, who inly seem&rsquo;d to fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For place and power, his fellows strove to cheer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sickly smile; and courtier lords obscene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Temper&rsquo;d new filth, to daub their libell&rsquo;d <span class="smcap">Queen</span>.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Sudden amid the peers whom <span class="smcap">England</span> hails<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Her</span> nobles&mdash;men who fail but when <small>SHE</small> fails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vision rose. It was a rev&rsquo;rend form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of aged dignity: its eye was warm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With kindlings of a spirit that of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made those walls tremble through its earthly mould.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now a mild glory round its presence play&rsquo;d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And &rsquo;spoke from heav&rsquo;nly courts the awful shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its brow wore high reproof; the lifted arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was stretch&rsquo;d for pleading; and there was a charm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of coming eloquence, as firm it stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one whose rank was with the great and good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well that rank was own&rsquo;d, when <span class="smcap">Erskine</span> cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis England&rsquo;s <span class="smcap">Chatham</span>!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Chatham</span>!&rdquo; all replied.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
<span class="i1">Like the dead stillness of the summer air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When pregnant clouds of shrouded fire are there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sat:&mdash;and like the voice of thunder broke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rolling periods, as the vision spoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Is this,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;the consecrated floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where England&rsquo;s peerage stood, as known of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jealous of honour, zealous for the laws;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Justice their sword, and England&rsquo;s weal their cause?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are these the walls whose echoes then return&rsquo;d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No words that chasten&rsquo;d gallantry had spurn&rsquo;d?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is this the throne whose last loved tenant view&rsquo;d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His people&rsquo;s morals as the monarch&rsquo;s good?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Display&rsquo;d beneath the sov&rsquo;reign diadem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Domestic virtue</span>, Britain&rsquo;s dearest gem;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade <em>Example</em> to <em>his</em> court proclaim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What taught, unpractis&rsquo;d, is the teacher&rsquo;s shame?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah no! that throne is chang&rsquo;d; this gew-gaw thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Befits a raree-shew, not England&rsquo;s King!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And can it be that Brunswick&rsquo;s cherish&rsquo;d heir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will also change the laws which plac&rsquo;d him there?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forget the <span class="smcap">Stuart&rsquo;s fate</span>, the <span class="smcap">Brunswick&rsquo;s oath</span>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet make his sorrowing subjects dwell on both?<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Forbid it, Heaven! Far other thoughts he knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When yet his talents with his graces grew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Genius, Beauty, in his circle ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admired the prince, and half adored the man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor now <em>thus</em> fall&rsquo;n!&mdash;Yet whence this hot cabal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of treasury bench, and bench episcopal?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These monstrous portents that before me rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mitred pimps, and coronetted spies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This deep, dark plotting, spreading net and snare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By hands that used their country&rsquo;s ark to bear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This hateful truckling to misguided power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Combined in palace, temple, hall, and bower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To crush an outcast Queen, with evidence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By facts refuted, ridiculed by sense?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tales that would merit but an equal fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Told of the veriest wench in Billingsgate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Fathers</span>! and <span class="smcap">Britons</span>! whence this alien band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of miscreant lechers bribed from sea and land?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By England spurn&rsquo;d, yet plied with England&rsquo;s gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till every scoundrel&rsquo;s stock of oaths was sold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hither sent by hirelings vile as they,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pass for sterling truth in open day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Monstrous fatuity! and British peers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have lent these vermin not unwilling ears;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For new-born lies have barter&rsquo;d ancient law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke public faith, to patch a private flaw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made a court that freemen never saw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Accusers, Jury, Judges</span>, <em>all in <small>ONE</small></em>!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O England! now be firm, or be undone!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or grov&rsquo;lling lick the dust to rise no more!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard I aright? and was it <small>HERE</small> I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This crew &rsquo;gainst England&rsquo;s <span class="smcap">Consort Queen</span> preferred?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here did their sland&rsquo;rous breath infest the air?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence did malicious tongues the scandal bear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gush&rsquo;d &rsquo;neath this sacred dome the prurient flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of filth and venom, from that viper brood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which o&rsquo;er the land hath spread its noisome stain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While shudd&rsquo;ring virtue weeps, but weeps in vain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And (O shame&rsquo;s nauseous dregs!) did noble lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here taste that stream with epicurean sips?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mitred heads, as o&rsquo;er its scum they bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snuff the rank steam, and chuckle at the scent?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul is sick!&mdash;I turn with sated ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And find a cordial in my brethren here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peers who their conscience to no market bring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Respect themselves, their country, and their king:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor would round England&rsquo;s smiling hearths diffuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breath&mdash;the very atmosphere of stews.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O horrid! yes, I feel the blast impure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Air no blessed spirit may unpained endure:<br /></span>

reverend body. Some of them, I firmly believe, have remained at
a distance from the combat, aged and infirm, like <span class="smcap">Eli</span>, sitting by
the wayside of Shiloh, and watching with trembling heart, lest the
ark (I will not say of <span class="smcap">God</span>, but of <small>THE CONSTITUTION</small>) should fall in
the unhallowed conflict. Others, perhaps, have not cared to meddle
in what they may have considered a doubtful matter: but it must
not be concealed, that when <small>TRUTH</small> and <small>JUSTICE</small> are at stake, <em>neutrality</em>
is no honourable sanctuary for the avowed servants of the <small>TEMPLE</small>.
Let the Bishops beware of discovering their nakedness upon the
very steps of the altar.&mdash;The eye of an enlightened people is upon
them; and <em>with their character for real consistent <small>PIETY</small>, and fidelity to

<p><span style="font-size: x-large">THE APOCRYPHAL NEW TESTAMENT</span>,
Being all the Gospels, Epistles, and other pieces now extant, attributed
in the first four centuries to JESUS CHRIST, his Apostles,
and their companions, and not included in the New Testament by
its compilers. Translated from the original, and now first collected
into One Volume, with a Preface and Tables.</p>

<p><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> <i>The Books that exist, of those not included in the Canon, are carefully
brought together into the present volume. They naturally assume the
title of the <span class="smcap">Apocryphal New Testament</span>; and he who possesses this and
the New Testament, has, in the two volumes, a collection of all the Historical
Records relative to Christ and his Apostles, now in existence, and considered
sacred by Christians during the first four centuries after his birth.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Contents.</span></p>

<p><i>Preface.</i><br />
<i>Gospel of the birth of Mary.</i><br />
<i>The Protevangelion, or birth of Christ
and the Virgin, by James the lesser.</i><br />
<i>The first Gospel of the Infancy of Christ.</i><br />
<i>Thomas&rsquo;s Gospel of the Infancy.</i><br />
<i>Epistles of Christ and Abgarus.</i><br />

<p><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> By the publication of this Volume, the Editor conceives he
has rendered an acceptable service to the <span class="smcap">Theological Student</span> and
the <span class="smcap">Ecclesiastical Antiquary</span>:&mdash;he has endeavoured to render it
more gratifying to the reader, and more convenient for reference, by
arranging the Books into Chapters, and dividing the Chapters into
verses.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lover of Old Literature</span> will here find the obscure but unquestionable
origin of several remarkable relations, in the Golden
Legend, the Lives of the Saints, and similar productions, concerning
the Parentage and Birth of the Virgin, her Marriage with Joseph on
the budding of his rod, the Nativity of Jesus, the Miracles of his Infancy,
his laboring with Joseph at the Carpentry trade, the actions
of his Followers, his Descent into Hell, &amp;c.</p>

<p style="padding-bottom: 3em;">Several of the <span class="smcap">Papal Pageants</span> for the Populace and the <span class="smcap">Monkish
Mysteries</span> performed as <i>Dramas</i> at Chester, Coventry, Newcastle,
and in other parts of England, are almost verbatim representations of
the stories. Many valuable <i>Pictures</i> by the best masters&mdash;<i>Prints</i> by
the early Engravers, and particularly of the Italian and German
Schools&mdash;<i>Woodcuts</i> in early black letter and block books&mdash;and <i>Illuminations</i>
of missals and monastic MSS.&mdash;receive immediate elucidation
on reference to the <span class="smcap">Apocryphal New Testament</span>, and are without
explanation from any other source.</p>
